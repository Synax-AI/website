Before investing in a stock, it's essential to understand not only the company but also the industry it operates in. Industry research helps you gain insights into market trends, risks, and factors that can impact the company's performance. 

Even if a company is doing well, a downturn in the industry or the broader market can affect its stock price. On the other hand, a strong industry can help companies thrive. Understanding the sub-industries within a sector can also give you a better idea of the market dynamics and help you make informed decisions.
